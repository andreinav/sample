Read me for R project


To run the code:



1. Open the econ_skills.Rproj file

This will open an RStudio window.



2. Open run_file.R file

If the run_file.R does not open automatically, go to Files window within RStudio (next to Plots) and open the file.




3. Load libraries

If you do not have the required libraries, uncomment the install functions to install them. This only has to be done once per computer. Then load the libraries.




4. Load the growth_accaunting() function

To load the function, run the source('source_function.R') code




5. Run calculation

The growth_accaunting() function runs the necessary calculations and exports them into a results file in csv format. All the flexible parameters of growth accounting are accessible with this function and can be changed to the necessary requirements. Make sure that the growth_accounting.dta file is in the same path as the project files.
